Project Aesel
=============

Aesel is a project aimed at bringing together the digital and physical worlds to connect us in new, diverse ways.

Computers today and the Internet allow for an unprecedented level of communication.
However, these same computers sit between their users, both metaphorically and literally.
So, while we are all connected, we are also isolated.

We believe that there is a different way to interact with the digital world, one that does not
isolate us and force us away from each other.  We believe that there is a way to communicate
digitally that can also be personal, and powerful.

Aesel is a back-end server architecture built to allow this architecture by independently
communicating between arbitrary devices.  It tracks object locations, rotations, and scaling
and streams these out to devices that need them, as well as tracking relationships between
different coordinate systems.  It will also ensure that 3D assets are distributed to all
necessary devices.
