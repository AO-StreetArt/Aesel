The easiest way to get started with Aesel is with `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__
and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__.  Before continuing,
please be sure to follow the steps in the following links:

* https://docs.docker.com/install/
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

.. admonition:: Note

   * Docker Community Edition is more than sufficient, but if you already have a subscription to Docker Enterprise, that will work perfectly well too.
   * Windows users will typically have compose installed with Docker, and won't need to follow the steps in the second link.
