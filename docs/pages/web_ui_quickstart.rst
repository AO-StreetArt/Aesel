Using the Aesel Web Browser
===========================

The Aesel Web Browser is great for exploring and learning about the Aesel API, as
well as for administering and creating applications using Aesel.

The navigation bar at the top of the page contains links to the various sections
of the browser, including 'Projects', 'Scenes', and 'Assets'.

Assets
------

Assets are files stored in the Aesel cloud, which can include image files,
scripts, or 3D export files (such as .obj or .blend).  In the Asset Browser,
you can query for different assets, and view a preview of many of them.

Double-click on any record in the data grid to load it into the Asset Viewer.

Scenes
------

A Scene consists of a number of renderable Objects, which users can collaboratively
manipulate.  In the Scene Browser, you can query for various Scenes, and see the
Objects and Assets associated with each one.

Double-click on any record in the Scene Grid to load the corresponding Objects
into the Object Grid.

Projects
--------

A Project consists of groups of Scenes and Assets.  These can be used to
organize your work in Aesel.

Double-click on any record in the data grid to load the thumbnail and description.
