Aesel Components
================

:ref:`Go Home <index>`

Aesel is not actually a single program, but a number of programs all running independently
and communicating with each other.  This allows for built-in redundancy to achieve
both high-availability, and scalablity to respond quickly to large changes in volume.

Below you can find the components that comprise the Aesel Architecture:
