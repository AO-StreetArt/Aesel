We love pull requests from everyone.  By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct, specified in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file.

Please note that, if you are contributing code, you are most likely going to want to contribute to one of the components utilized by Aesel, rather than this repository.  Please refer to the documentation on contributing to that component when doing so.

If you need to make updates to this repository, start by forking and cloning the repository, then making any updates necessary and testing.

Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests
* Comment your code
* Write a good commit message
* If you have many different commits, use rebase to consolidate down to a single commit
